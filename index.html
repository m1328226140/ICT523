		          <p>I am very interested in data collection and needs analysis, 
				  which happens to be what we are doing in this course. Data analysis can completely and correctly reflect the whole picture of the objective situation, and can also help enterprises solve problems. So I like data collection and needs analysis. I will take this course seriously, understand what I don't know, study hard, and do my best.</p></div>
